### WTF is minitrue?

 `minitrue`, otherwise known as the Ministry of Truth, is an organization in George Orwell's novel, *Nineteen Eighty-Four*, that manages propaganda within a region called Oceania.

Prolefeed is any deliberately superficial literature, movies and music that were produced to keep the "proles" (i.e., proletariat) content and to prevent them from becoming too knowledgeable.

The proles are analogous to React Components.
