`minitrue` (Ministry of Truth) create `Probe` cursors that reference a single object reference containing an Immutable Map.

All created `Probe` cursors via another `Probe` cursor point to the same single source of truth.

Any two `Probe` cursors with the same keypath will point to the same value.

## Usage

```
$ npm install --save minitrue
```

### API

### `minitrue`

Create and return a `Probe` object with `data` as its unboxed root data.
If `data` is not an `Immutable` collection, it'll be converted into one via
`Immutable.fromJS(data)`.

```js

const truth = minitrue({
    'two plus two': {
        answer: 'five'
    }
});
```

### `Probe`

See [Probe API](https://github.com/Dashed/probe).
